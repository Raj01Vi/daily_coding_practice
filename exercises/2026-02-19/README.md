Mini Project: Number Statistics Tool

Write a program that:
	1.	Asks the user to enter 5 numbers
	2.	Stores them in a list
	3.	Prints:
	•	The largest number
	•	The smallest number
	•	The average
	4.	Bonus:
	•	Count how many numbers are even

Constraints:
	•	Use a loop
	•	Use a list
	•	Do NOT use built-in max() or min() (we’ll learn that properly later)
	•	Keep it clean and simple

This introduces:
	•	Lists
	•	Iterative comparison
	•	Accumulator pattern

Only one file. No overengineering.
